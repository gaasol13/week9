        <p style="text-align: justify;">Back in the 1980s, Communicative Language Teaching transformed language
          education by focusing on real-life interaction and communication. Technology strengthens this approach, making interaction and collaboration more accessible.
          <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336927699_Theoretical_frameworks_used_in_CALL_studies_A_systematic_review"><b>Sedat Akayoglu</b>
          </a>
          reviewed some relevant second language acquisition theories in CALL studies, and one influential framework in this
          context is the Sociocultural theory by Lev Vygotsky.
          Its impact in CALL studies notes that language learning develops through social interaction in activities such
          as collaborative writing, dialogue, and negotiation of meaning-making.
          With the rapid expansion of the internet, digital platforms have made communication easier and more
          accessible, fostering collective learning and the exchange of ideas.
          These platforms improve learners’ performance through teamwork, feedback, and meaningful tasks.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">The research by
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.5430/wjel.v14n5p493"><b>Dakamsih and Rababah</b>
          </a>highlights the role of Microsoft Team platform in strengthening students’ writing ability.
          It fosters collaboration and community building, enabling students to work together on writing tasks and
          encouraging them to actively participate in writing discussions and exchanging ideas.
          Moreover, Microsoft Teams also provides instant and real-life feedback through comments and recommendations in
          the writing tasks from teachers and peers.
          Students can make adjustments and revisions in line with the feedback and track their improvement over time.
          Consequently, Microsoft Teams empowers learners to engage in interactive learning with peers and instructors,
          receive support, and refine their language skills continuously.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most common difficulties in language classrooms is addressing the variety of proficiency levels. 
          <a href="https://journals.ikiu.ac.ir/article_2545_f97c2abb40b3d63080cfa2646470c5b8.pdf?lang=en"><b>Rafi, Pourdana and Ghaemi</b></a>
          discuss how Google Meet, another digital platform similar to Microsoft Team, helps language teachers create a more inclusive and adaptable learning environment 
          by implementing scaffolding strategies. Tasks can be assigned and adapted according to each student’s proficiency level, 
          ensuring that learners work in activities that are accessible but also challenging. 
          Therefore, students can be grouped according to their level or learning needs and work on tiered tasks while receiving real-time feedback. 
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Text chat tools complement digital platforms like Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams to create a supportive learning environment 
          that encourages student collaboration, helps refine their writing, and develops self-regulation strategies.
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/09588221.2022.2092153"><b>Udeshinee, Knutsson, Barbutiu and Jayathilake</b></a>
          emphasize how text chats in Zoom platform can facilitate Dynamic Assessment, drawing on sociocultural theory and the concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), 
          the gap between what a learner can do independently and what they can achieve with guidance of a more knowledgeable speaker. 
          Text chat also facilitates teachers to provide continual dynamic assessment, making their feedback more effective and adaptable to each student’s individual needs.
          This process can be improved by designing regulatory scales.
         </p>

         <p style="text-align: justify;">In my experience as a Spanish as a Foreign Language teacher, the use of breakout rooms has been highly effective. 
          By grouping students according to their target language level or specific learning needs, and giving them specific tasks through shared documents, 
          I have seen how collaborative learning strengthens language learning and ensures that students receive the support they need. 
          Moreover, in digital platforms such as Google Meet, Microsoft Teams or Zoom lessons can be recorded and shared, allowing learners to review and reinforce their learning.
