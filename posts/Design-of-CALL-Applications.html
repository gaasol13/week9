        <p style="text-align: justify;">The design of CALL applications goes beyond simply integrating technology into
          the language learning experience. Effective CALL design requires a careful balance between different aspects
          such as pedagogy, learners' needs, and technological affordances. As digital tools become more sophisticated,
          the challenge is not just about selecting the right software but also structuring CALL designs to various
          learning environments.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In her article,
          <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.elib.tcd.ie/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2017.1329216#abstract">
            <b>Sun (2017)</b>
          </a>
          introduces 'design for learning', a CALL design approach that shifts the focus to the learning process. She
          references two design approaches to support her argument:
          <a href="https://www-jstor-org.elib.tcd.ie/stable/24156348?seq=1">
            <b>Colpaert (2006)</b>
          </a>
          pedagogy-driven CALL design, which emphasizes the specification of what is needed for language teaching and
          learning in a specific context, and Social CALL, which positions learners as active agents in the target
          language and emphasizes learner agency and authentic interaction. Effective CALL design requires understanding
          students’ linguistic, cultural, and technological needs and background. She advocates for a dynamic and
          forward-oriented method structured in four phases:
        <ul>
          <li>Design for configuration by anticipating learners’ needs and allowing adjustments,</li>
          <li>Design for orchestration by supporting teachers in managing various learning processes</li>
          <li>Design for reflection by incorporating systems evaluation mechanisms to assess effectiveness, and</li>
          <li>Design for re-design ensuring flexibility for continuous improvements. CALL design. </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">CALL design should position learners as active participants, fostering
          interaction with people and resources.
          Additionally, it should also consider the architecture of learning which includes different factors such as
          digital tools, materials, physical spaces, and social roles.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In a recent study on designing smartphone language learning apps for older
          learners (+60),
          <a href="https://journal.gerontechnology.org/archives/99d903760b55487291add5dbc33bff3d.pdf">
            <b>Puebla et al. (2022)</b>
          </a>
          adopted a user-centered design (UCD) approach known as design thinking (DT). By involving target learners
          throughout the development process and incorporating their specific needs, preferences, and abilities, the
          researchers gained a deeper insight into older learners’ requirements and proposed a set of principles to
          guide future technology solutions. They followed five steps -empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test –
          grouped into three main phases. In the phase I ‘Needfinding’, interviews highlighted older learners’ needs for
          social interaction, active lifestyle, and authentic communication. During the phase II ‘Brainstorming’, canvas
          was used as idea generation and lead to the idea of a platform matching older L2 learners based on their
          profiles, target languages, and common interests. In the phase III ‘Prototype’, participants tested the app,
          completed tasks, and answererd a feedback questionnaire. The app Sprachen Tanz foster both social and
          collaborative interaction by creating a learning community where knowledge is constructed together, and also
          learner autonomy by allowing users to choose roles (tutor or learner), preferred activities, and learning
          formats (small group or partners). Although the results show significant potential for promoting language
          acquisition among older users, the small and homogeneous sample restricts the generalizability of these
          findings.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In another recent investigation of adults’ online language education,
          <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.elib.tcd.ie/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2022.2158202#abstract">
            <b>Bergdahl (2022)</b>
          </a>
          highlights how teachers’ learning designs can drive engagement and language development in L2 learners. First,
          she advises that teachers should begin by assessing their learners’ linguistic and digital needs alongside the
          available technological tools. Next, educators are encouraged to identify core elements that can promote
          engagement in online language acquisition such as scaffolding tasks, balancing real-time and self-paced
          activities, and integrating different skills within the same session. Once these elements are in place, she
          suggests organizing them in a coherent learning sequence and gathering feedback through classroom
          observations. Finally, teachers refine their learning designs ensuring that the CALL application remain
          adaptive and relies on both teachers’ digital competences and context-aware strategies that encourage active
          participation.
