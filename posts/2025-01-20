          <h3>2. Where I am from &#127757</h3>
          <p>I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain, but Dublin has been home for the last six years.</p>
            

          <h3>3. Why I am here &#129300</h3>
          <p>The reason for attending TCD is to upskill and gained formal education in linguistics and language education. 
            After five years of teaching Spanish, I have decided to pursue a Master's degree to deepen my understanding 
            of language acquisition theories, refine my teaching practice, and explore new opportunities in the field of language education.</p>
          

          <h3>4. What I hope to achieve &#128640</h3>
          <p>In the future, I hope to keep developing my skills and evolving in the field of language education.
            I want to design more inclusive and interactive lessons, and new technologies can open up exciting 
            new ways to engage learners and teachers.</p>
