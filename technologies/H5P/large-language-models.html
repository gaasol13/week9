        <p style="text-align: justify;">As discussed in previous posts, new technologies rapidly evolve and integrate
          into language learning environments, positively impacting second language acquisition (SLA). Beyond speech
          synthesis and recognition, Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive language texts and can generate
          human-like texts, offering more practice opportunities for learners. This is especially relevant in a foreign
          language context, where exposure to the target language outside the classroom is often limited.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">LLMs have been shown to support EFL writing skills, as demonstrated by
          <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.elib.tcd.ie/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2024.2389923">
            <b>Liu et al.(2024)</b>

          in a summer camp program organized by the sponsoring university, involving sixth-grade learners from the same
          elementary school. The researchers used the Cognitive Academic Language Approach (CALLA), which emphasized
          self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies through scaffolding methods that progressively foster learners’
          independent learning skills. The study developed and examined the impact of LLMs on three key aspects of
          writing success: composition scores, SRL strategy use, and writing motivation. The real-time feedback,
          personalized support and adaptive scaffolding provided by LLMs enhance both SRL strategy use and writing
          motivation, ultimately improving writing performance. Although LLMs serve as a valuable instructional and
          dynamic scaffolding tool that accommodate each student’s Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), the study
          highlighted that they should not replace teachers. Instead, educators remain central to guiding the learning
          process, while LLMs complement instruction by providing individualized support and immediate feedback.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Turning to speaking practice and based on Long’s Interactional Hypothesis
          (1981), which underscores the importance of interaction and negotiation of meaning in second language
          acquisition (SLA),
          <a
            href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/386988643_Pecha_A_Language_Practice_Peer_Guiding_Language_Learning_Interactions_Through_Large_Language_Models">
            <b>Lege, Bonner and Aikawa (2024)</b>
          </a>
          explored the application of LLMs as practice partners for language learning. The authors developed Pecha, an
          AI application implemented in two contexts: Japanese EFL university students and Japanese learners at an
          English-speaking university. The application was applied as a peer assistant, integrating LLMs into
          conversation practice where authentic language practice opportunities are limited. It is designed to support
          rather than replace human interaction, providing speech-to-text diarization for transcriptions, vocabulary and
          grammar feedback, and text-to-speech for conversation summaries. While Pecha improves interactive engagement
          by offering dynamic scaffolding, provides adaptive real-time support that adjusts to learners’ needs, and
          encourages self-reflection through post-interaction analysis, some limitations were noted, such as
          transcription accuracy, speaker differentiation, and maintaining coherence in long conversations.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Building on speaking practice,
          <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.elib.tcd.ie/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2025.2453191#abstract">
            <b>Zheng et al. (2025)</b>
          </a>
          investigated how LLMs can function as collaborative dialogue partners in developing learners’ communicative
          competence, offering learners more opportunities for practice and giving them real-time language evaluation
          and feedback. In the study, over four weeks, Chinese EFL first-year students from the same university took
          part in four oral practice sessions, and the researchers integrated LLMs through GPT-4.0 into four stages: (1)
          pre-speaking, where the LLM provides specialized vocabulary relevant to the topic; (2) while-speaking,
          simulating real oral communication scenarios; (3) post-speaking, where learners engage in self-assessment
          through interaction; and (4) extension practice, through repeated oral tasks. EFL learners in the study showed
          a significant reduction in foreign language anxiety and greater improvement in willingness to communicate and
          self-efficacy, which ultimately led to improved oral proficiency. Furthermore, LLMs are regarded not only as
          collaborative dialogue partners but also as more knowledgeable partners, which aligns with the ZPD theory of
          Vygotsky.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">To sum up, these studies highlight how LLMs can effectively serve as scaffolds
          for productive skills. They offer consistent, individualized practices with immediate feedback and interactive
          guidance, fostering motivation while reducing anxiety. However, teachers should carefully guide the
          integration of LLMs to ensure these tools align with learning objectives and remain accessible to diverse
          learner profiles.
