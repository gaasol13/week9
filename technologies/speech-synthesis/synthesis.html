        <h3>Improving pronunciation, accent control, and independent learning</h3>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past five years, speech synthesis has become an essential part of
        Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL), offering learners greater access to realistic
        and authentic examples of spoken language. This is especially relevant in foreign language contexts,
        where direct exposure to the target language input is limited.
        As a Spanish teacher in Dublin, I have observed that, despite their motivation,
        students often struggle to find real-world opportunities to practice their Spanish comprehension,
        speaking, and pronunciation, as Spanish is rarely spoken outside the classroom.
        In these situations, Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies
        significantly increase learners’ opportunities to practice the target language.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">An important area within CALL is Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT),
        where speech synthesis provides both comprehensive input
        and artificial data for training error-detection systems. Traditionally, CAPT programs compare a learner’s
        spoken output to a single correct version,
        ignoring the complexity of real-world pronunciation. Researchers now explore more flexible methods that address
        lexical stress, prosody, and other linguistic features.
        <a href="https://www-sciencedirect-com.elib.tcd.ie/science/article/pii/S0167639322000863"><b>Korzekwa,
            Lorenzo-Trueba, Drugman and Kostek</b>
        </a>
        highlight the shortage of data with pronunciation errors. They introduce three Artificial Intelligence (AI)
        approaches to generate more realistic mispronunciation errors:
        Phoneme-to-Phoneme (P2P) modifies phoneme transcriptions while preserving the original audio, Text-to-Speech
        (T2S) creates new audios aligned with incorrect transcriptions,
        and Speech-to-Speech (S2S) changes recordings by introducing pronunciation errors. By creating more examples of
        common learners’ mistakes, these techniques improve the accuracy
        in detecting errors and provide more precise and varied feedback considering pronunciation features such as
        lexical stress or prosody.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">Recent researches has focused on speech synthesis systems that allow explicit
        accent intensity control.
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.10804"><b>Liu, Sisman, Gao and Li</b>
        </a>
        propose a T2S model called Controllable Accented Text-to-Speech that generates speech with a foreign accent
        rather than a native one. It regulates prosodic features like pitch, energy, and duration.
        This approach is particularly relevant to CALL, as it exposes learners to different accents and dialects,
        reflecting the diversity found in real-world language use. As a result, learners can familiarize themselves with
        various accent intensities, and improve their listening comprehension to a wide range of speaking styles.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">In the context of foreign language learning, it is useful to integrate speech
        synthesis technologies into self-directed practice.
        Since many students do not have regular opportunities to communicate in the target language, these technologies
        allow learners
        to listen and compare their own speech with synthetic models, focusing on features like intonation.
        <a
          href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/8d064a8c-e771-47db-99c0-97fb583a6d2d/content"><b>Lieshout
            and Cardoso</b>
        </a>
        explore how Google Translate (GT), although not originally designed for educational purposes, allows learners to
        instantly hear written text aloud
        and provides immediate feedback by converting their spoken input into text.
        As a result, learners can verify their pronunciation accuracy and refine their speech more effectively.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">To sum up, the integration of speech synthesis into foreign language learning
        provides
        effective opportunities for learners beyond the traditional classroom. The authentic input and the refined error
        detection
        of these technologies help students practice independently and receive immediate feedback. Meanwhile, advances
        in accent intensity models allow for greater exposure to various accents in the target language, allowing
        learners
        to become more confident and flexible in real-world communication.
